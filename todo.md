# Things to be done to make all the things look and work amazingly well

## important
- code cleanup
	- split out FMCW and DOPP properly
	- add method to toggle between two modes using user button
	- add totally unneeded comments
- update graphing functions to work with dynamic scale

## mid
- fix "forgetting function" to have less problems at (t=0)
- update search/rendering window to only display data within our search bounds (9-15m max)
- manually remove peaks from electronic harmonics or whatever (one at 11.5m, as an example)
- take faster samples
- dual mode behavior

## less important
- use correct ADC input channels
- take background measurement, remove from readings

## not my problem
- add UI for car/product + better visualization for demo
